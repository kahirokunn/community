## Contributions to Knative

- **Enhanced Knative Operator:** Expanded the configurable API surface of the Knative Operator, empowering users with greater flexibility and control over their deployments. [Explore my contributions](https://github.com/knative/operator/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Akahirokunn+is%3Aclosed).

## Why I'm running

At KA-NABELL, Japan’s largest trading card e-commerce platform, I drive the evolution of our cloud-native infrastructure—built entirely on Knative. By leveraging Knative’s well-defined interfaces, we’ve transformed how our teams build, deploy, secure, and monitor both our management functions and microservices. This approach not only simplifies the complexities inherent in a distributed system but also delivers exceptional cost efficiency; for example, our microservices outside of business hours cost literally 0 dollars.

Our deep integration with Knative has allowed us to standardize processes across our organization, providing a robust foundation that scales with our business. However, being a heavy user of Knative has also revealed opportunities for further innovation, such as the following:

- **Enhanced Authentication & Session Management:** Advanced extensions that leverage Knative to streamline security and improve user experience.
- **Optimized Workload APIs:** Designing scalable APIs that support high-demand operations while maintaining cost efficiency.
- **Advanced HTTPRoute Extensions:** Crafting secure and efficient routing solutions to ensure seamless connectivity and service reliability.
- **Innovative Cloud-Native Best Practices:** Pioneering strategies that harness the full power of Knative, driving continuous improvement in our platform’s agility and performance.
- **Harmonizing Multi-Cluster & Multi-Environment Operations**: Innovating robust strategies to synchronize configurations and revisions across various environments, thereby empowering a more streamlined and resilient GitOps workflow.

I look forward to serving as a bridge between our engineering teams and the broader user community, and contribute to the evolution of Knative by promoting continuous innovation from a unique perspective.
